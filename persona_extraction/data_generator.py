        This was a great read as it explored several controversial views but narrated them extremely well to show how arguments could tip onto either side of the line when it comes to making a deciding decision on such creative ownership matters.


        The paper explores the intersection of generative AI, advertising, and intellectual property (IP). As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent in advertising, complex IP issues arise. Authorship, ownership, copyright, and fair use in the context of AI-generated content, highlight the need for updated laws, regulations, and industry practices to address these challenges.

        From the points raised in this article I think the creative arts  industry must adapt to the implications of generative AI on IP. My key summaries were that Clarity is needed on authorship and ownership of AI-generated content. Copyright laws and fair use guidelines must be updated to accommodate AI-generated works.  Advertisers must be aware of potential IP infringement and take steps to clear rights or use public domain materials.  New business models and regulations must emerge to address the IP challenges of generative AI.

        The paper's comparison of different IP infringements issues over the last few decades, (ranging from paintings and their replicas and then photographic material) puts a different perspective on this issue. Moreover the comparison to AI generated mimicry of songs / styles to mimes and other such human based replicas do raise a question about when does art become a copied piece vs when is it original. The author, through his examples, displays (at least in my opinion) very well that it completely depends on what is considered art and who values what part of it. Do we value the original composers/artists and pay for that or do we pay for their style and design? 


        On top of all these, what I see is that AI generated art raises community based concerns towards careers in art and financial support for creativity. GANs and AI generated art is becoming easy to grab and approachable to use removing the need for artists for daily use cases. But as the argument goes overtime this will just be viewed as a tool just as Google's Image search is now (which at some point was taking away photographerâ€™s jobs).


        Overall, the paper highlights the importance of addressing IP issues in the context of generative AI and advertising to ensure a thriving and innovative industry.

        Discussion Question : Do you think fusion of art (copying content from multiple different sources and putting them together) is considered a new form of art or not. And if so do we consider AI to have creative intelligence and hence not require IP rights?

        Artificial General Intelligence

        The authors aim to create a framework for classifying the capabilities and behavior of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models and their precursors. The paper claims that the proposed framework will help track progress toward AGI, identify potential risks, and guide research efforts. As a comparison the authors analyzed nine case studies of prior prominent formulations of the concept of AGI, including the Loebner Prize, the Turing Test, and the Winograd Schema Challenge. 

        Through this paper we see the authors propose a matrixed ontology, the "Levels of AGI," which considers a combination of performance and generality. The six levels of Performance (No AI, Emerging, Competent, Expert, Virtuoso, and Superhuman) and the six levels of Autonomy (No AI, AI as a Tool, AI as a Consultant, AI as a Collaborator, AI as an Expert, and AI as an Agent) provide a nuanced metric for evaluating AGI systems. 

        The authors demonstrate the applicability of the Levels of AGI framework by analyzing several AI systems, including AlphaGo, Watson, and Siri. The framework provides a clear and operationalizable definition of AGI, enabling researchers and policymakers to communicate more effectively about progress toward AGI and potential risks.

        Apart from its nuanced approach and comprehensive framework, the framework also draws my attention to several of its issues. For beginners the framework may be too complicated for some stake holders requiring significant experitise. Additionally the assignment of AGI levels may involve subjective judgements, potentially leading to disagreements and inconsistencies. The framework also has a limited generalizibility (to all models / AI and contexts) potentially limiting its applicability. It would also need to evolve as AGI capabilities and autononomy continue to adavnce hence potentially requiring revision. In my personal opinion I also believe that there was a lack of clear boundaries between AGI levels, they seems to be confusing at some points. Furthermore some may argue that the framework overemphasizes autonomy and could be overlooking other aspects of AGI. Last but not the least i feel like the framework is a bit reliant on benchmark and metrics which could be incomplete/ biased/ inaccurate which may impact the validity.

        Overall the framework proposed in this paper has done a great job in the domain of AGI. The framework serves as a foundation for tracking progress toward AGI and guiding research efforts to achieve responsible and beneficial AGI. Shared terminology and frameworks can help researches, policymakers and other stakeholders communicate more clearly about progress toward powerful AI systems. I think this paves the path for better understanding of the concept.
