    Artificial General Intelligence

    The authors aim to create a framework for classifying the capabilities and behavior of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models and their precursors. The paper claims that the proposed framework will help track progress toward AGI, identify potential risks, and guide research efforts. As a comparison the authors analyzed nine case studies of prior prominent formulations of the concept of AGI, including the Loebner Prize, the Turing Test, and the Winograd Schema Challenge. 

    Through this paper we see the authors propose a matrixed ontology, the "Levels of AGI," which considers a combination of performance and generality. The six levels of Performance (No AI, Emerging, Competent, Expert, Virtuoso, and Superhuman) and the six levels of Autonomy (No AI, AI as a Tool, AI as a Consultant, AI as a Collaborator, AI as an Expert, and AI as an Agent) provide a nuanced metric for evaluating AGI systems. 

    The authors demonstrate the applicability of the Levels of AGI framework by analyzing several AI systems, including AlphaGo, Watson, and Siri. The framework provides a clear and operationalizable definition of AGI, enabling researchers and policymakers to communicate more effectively about progress toward AGI and potential risks.

    Apart from its nuanced approach and comprehensive framework, the framework also draws my attention to several of its issues. For beginners the framework may be too complicated for some stake holders requiring significant experitise. Additionally the assignment of AGI levels may involve subjective judgements, potentially leading to disagreements and inconsistencies. The framework also has a limited generalizibility (to all models / AI and contexts) potentially limiting its applicability. It would also need to evolve as AGI capabilities and autononomy continue to adavnce hence potentially requiring revision. In my personal opinion I also believe that there was a lack of clear boundaries between AGI levels, they seems to be confusing at some points. Furthermore some may argue that the framework overemphasizes autonomy and could be overlooking other aspects of AGI. Last but not the least i feel like the framework is a bit reliant on benchmark and metrics which could be incomplete/ biased/ inaccurate which may impact the validity.

    Overall the framework proposed in this paper has done a great job in the domain of AGI. The framework serves as a foundation for tracking progress toward AGI and guiding research efforts to achieve responsible and beneficial AGI. Shared terminology and frameworks can help researches, policymakers and other stakeholders communicate more clearly about progress toward powerful AI systems. I think this paves the path for better understanding of the concept.
